# svelte-extras

Extra methods for [Svelte](https://svelte.technology) components.

## Usage

Install with npm or yarn...

```bash
npm install --save svelte-extras
```

...then add to your component methods:

```html
<input bind:value='newTodo'>
<button on:click='push("todos", newTodo)'>add todo</button>

<ul>
  {{#each todos as todo, i}}
    <li>
      <button on:click='splice("todos", i, 1)'>x</button>
      {{todo}}
    </li>
  {{/each}}
</ul>

<script>
  import { push, splice } from 'svelte-extras';

  export default {
    data: function () {
      return {
        newTodo: '',
        todos: ['add some more todos']
      };
    },

    methods: {
      push,
      splice
    }
  };
</script>
```

## Available methods

### Array methods ([live demo](https://svelte.technology/repl?gist=66bb8372ed59124c3568c26a2b39dce2))

* push
* pop
* shift
* unshift
* splice
* sort
* reverse

These all work exactly as their `Array.prototype` counterparts, except that the first argument must be the *keypath* that points to the array. The following are all examples of keypaths:

```js
component.push('todos', 'finish writing this documentation');
component.push('foo.bar.baz', 42);
component.push('rows[4]', cell);
```

### tween(key, end, options?) ([live demo](https://svelte.technology/repl?gist=996cc5446b4f12d0708d2d1fca9f53b6))

Smoothly tweens `key` from its current value to the `end` value. Numerical values (and non-cyclical objects and arrays, as long as their leaf properties are numerical) are automatically interpolated, or you can supply a custom function.

The available options (and default values) are:

* **delay** (0) — the delay in milliseconds before the tween starts
* **duration** (400) — the duration of the tween
* **easing** (x => x) — which easing function to use (see e.g. [eases-jsnext](https://github.com/rollup/eases-jsnext)))
* **interpolate** (see above) — a function that generators a custom interpolator, for e.g. transitioning strings representing colors. Must take arguments `a` and `b` and return a function that takes a value `t` between 0 and 1
* **adjustDuration** (false) — if `tween` is called on a key while a tween is already in progress on that key, adjust the duration of the new tween so that the same percentage of it remains that the previous tween had progressed. For example, If the previous tween's duration was 100ms and was aborted after 50ms, the tween that replaced it will be reduced by 50%.

This method returns a promise with an additional `abort` method. The tween will be aborted automatically if `key` is updated separately, either by a second tween or via `component.set(...)`. The promise will not resolve if the tween is aborted.


### observeDeep(keypath, callback, options?) ([live demo](https://svelte.technology/repl?gist=94f68745adb18799030ef4c732c9774d))

Exactly the same as the built-in `observe` method, except that it observes nested properties of objects and arrays, rather than the objects themselves. The `keypath` option is a string like `foo.bar` (observe the `bar` property of the `foo` object) or `baz[0]` (observe the first member of the `baz` array).

### getDeep(keypath) ([live demo](https://svelte.technology/repl?gist=42b551d60f971f953468a2142cfb25f3))

Similar to the built-in `get` method, except that it gets nested properties of objects and arrays, rather than the objects themselves. The `keypath` option is a string like `foo.bar` (get the `bar` property of the `foo` object) or `baz[0]` (get the first member of the `baz` array).

### setDeep(keypath, value) ([live demo](https://svelte.technology/repl?gist=e33d01f9796341992101d8c23070eb76))

Similar to the built-in `set` method, except that it sets nested properties of objects and arrays, rather than the objects themselves. The `keypath` option is a string like `foo.bar` (set the `bar` property of the `foo` object) or `baz[0]` (set the first member of the `baz` array).


## Tree-shaking

If you're using a module bundler that supports tree-shaking, such as [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org), only the methods your components use will be included in your app.


## Universal module definition

If you *really* need it, a UMD build is available at [svelte-extras/dist/svelte-extras.umd.js](https://unpkg.com/svelte-extras/dist/svelte-extras.js), and will register itself as `svelte.extras`. We recommend using a module bundler instead, however.
